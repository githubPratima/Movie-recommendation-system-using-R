Introduction: A recommender system helps users discover things they might like and buy by suggesting content or products. It uses various strategies based on available data to find what users are looking for, often surprising them with recommendations they didn't expect.

The central objective of movie recommendation systems is to sift through and forecast films that align closely with a particular user's preferences, increasing the likelihood of their interest in viewing.

Formulated the collaborative filtering model to recommend the best movies to the users based on previous ratings and interests.

 Built linear models and matrix factorization models, where the matrix factorization method yielded better results compared to a linear model.
