**Objective:** The central objective of movie recommendation systems is to sift through and forecast films that align closely with a particular user's preferences, increasing the likelihood of their interest in viewing. In simple word to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. 

**Process:** Formulated the collaborative filtering model to recommend the best movies to the users based on previous ratings and interests.

 **Result:** Built linear models and matrix factorization models, where the matrix factorization method yielded better results compared to a linear model.
